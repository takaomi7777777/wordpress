The official Google Publisher Plugin for AdSense, written by Google. Supported products include AdSense and Webmaster Tools.

== Description ==

The Google Publisher Plugin enables you to easily use Google's products - including Webmaster Tools - with your WordPress site.

To insert AdSense ads without the plugin would first involve generating the AdSense snippet and then pasting the Adsense snippet into either the text of the site or directly into the PHP. This plugin lets you place AdSense ads using a simple point-and-click UI. Google automatically determines potential placements for AdSense ads, suggests an initial ad layout, and gives you control over the placement of ads on your site.

This version of the Google Publisher Plugin allows you to:

* Easily add AdSense ads to your site to make money from advertising.
* **NEW** [Manually insert ads](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6051417?hl=en&ref_topic=3380274) in locations that you determine yourself. This gives you all the power of manual insertion of snippets while also being able to use the plugin’s great UI. You get full control plus point-and-click.
* **NEW** [Exclude pages](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6023216#disable) from having ads on them.
* Verify your site with Webmaster Tools with just one click.
* Manage your ads quickly and easily through a point-and-click interface.

Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements.

* PHP version 5.2.0 or greater.

In the site admin sidebar, click Plugins and select Add New. Enter “Google Publisher Plugin” in the search bar and click Search Plugins.

Find the Google Publisher Plugin in the list of results and click the Install Now link.

At this point, WordPress should automatically install the plugin.

If you have any trouble with automatic installation, you can try it manually. To do this:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this marked "beta"? =

We are still fine-tuning the plugin to make sure it works well on the many WordPress sites out there. We’d love for you to try it and give us feedback on how well it works for you and your site.

= Is this an official Google plugin? =

Yes, this plugin is developed and supported by Google. [Visit Google Help Center](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3380626) for more information.

= Can I use the Google Publisher Plugin on WordPress.com? =

At this time, the Google Publisher Plugin cannot be used on WordPress.com. WordPress.com [does not allow](http://en.support.wordpress.com/plugins/) this plugin on its hosted sites.

= The plugin didn’t find a location where I want to put an ad. How do I insert AdSense ads in those locations? =

You can now [manually insert ads](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6051417?hl=en&ref_topic=3380274) in locations that you determine yourself. This is an easy-to-use compromise between manual insertion of snippets yourself and the plugin’s easy-to-use UI. You get full control plus point-and-click. See the [help documentation](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6051417?hl=en&ref_topic=3380274) for more information.

= Why should I use this plugin as opposed to others? =

Google officially supports this plugin and any other method of putting the AdSense snippet on your page. This is the only plugin that delivers the Google-suggested ad experience for your site.

All plugins and placements must still adhere to the [AdSense Terms and Conditions](https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms) and it is the responsibility of the publisher to ensure that any tools used for AdSense obey those terms and conditions. It is usually up to the publisher to determine if your content violates ad policy or a placement is deceptive.
